# TabSwitch

TabSwitch (former TabBar) is a plugin for [QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/ide/), which implements a tabbed editor interface.

Old habits die hardly and I just wanted to have Visual-Studio-like interface in Qt Creator.

## Installation

To install, you need a source code of your QtCreator version (at the moment of writing this document, this is a 3.5.1,
but a newer version is also available)

- build a QtCreator from source;
- configure and build TabSwitcher;
- copy binary to your working QtCreator installation.

To configure, simply edit a tabswitch.pro file, adjusting following paths to your system:

Contact me if you need a binary build.
